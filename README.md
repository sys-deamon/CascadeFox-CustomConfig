# Customization
## Homepage Quote
You can customize everything related to the home-page quote (font, size, weight and position) in the `userContent.css` file.
## Theme
If you want to use the theme as mine:
- Download the firefox extension [Firefox Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&utm_medium=firefox-browser&utm_source=firefox-browser) and import the `manifest.json` file under the `Theme/` directory in the extension homepage.
